# Welcome!
As I learn more about web development, I'll be using this repo to try new things and use it as a portfolio of sorts. The address for the published page is www.nicoleneary.me.

If anyone has any tips and tricks, sees an issue with my code, or finds something that can be improved, I hugely encourage you to let me know. The only consequence of making a mistake on here is learning how to fix it.
